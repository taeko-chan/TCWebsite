        <h2>A Minecraft Server Like No Other...</h2>
        <p>Taeko & Co is a unique server. It's like a seperate world with infrastructure and cities and countries.</p>
        <p>It is the result of nearly two years of work (and counting!) by many people together. T&C is currently made</p>
        <p>up of 3 countries, Atteca, Lyria & Swarovski, each with cities, countryside and extensive history. </p>
        <p>As each country is run by seperate people, the focuses of each are different. I personally own Atteca, which</p>
        <p>has towns & cities scattered around the country, connected by an extensive & realistic road network, with</p>
        <p>the current large project being a new city called Wengen. Atteca's capital city, Atami, has been around</p>
        <p>almost as long as the server has, and is ever growing.</p><br>
